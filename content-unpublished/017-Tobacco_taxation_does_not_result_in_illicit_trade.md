# Tobacco taxation does not result in illicit trade.

> **KEY MESSAGE:** _Illicit tobacco trade exists not because of tobacco taxation, but because of poor controls over organised smuggling, counterfeiting, and cross-border imports. To curb illicit tobacco trade, it is essential to secure comprehensive strategies for tackling these criminal activities while keeping tobacco taxes high._

A common argument of the tobacco industry is that raising tobacco taxes will result in illicit tobacco trade. This argument is supported by tobacco industry-funded "research", which is often done by organisations that present themselves as independent of the tobacco industry. A good example is the International Tax and Investment Center (ITIC), a tobacco industry-funded lobby group which poses as an independent, non-profit research and education foundation.[^R1] Misleading tax arguments, built on an inaccurate evidence base, are then fed into mass media channels and used to influence decisions on tobacco control policy (see 2.2: ['It is important to prevent tobacco industry interference in tobacco control']()). This argument is perceived as logical by many, which makes it one of the hardest myths to counter; though with more countries opting for higher taxes along with better research, evidence to the contrary is growing.

In general, there is an inverse relationship between illicit trade and governance rather than taxation levels. To illustrate, in countries such as the UK where governance is good – i.e. tax administration and customs are effective and taxes are high – there is not much illicit trade (see case study: UK). In countries where governance is poor and taxes are low, illicit trade is more common. In 2007, high-income countries with an average price of $4.91 per pack had an average illicit market share of 9.8% whereas low-income countries, with an average price of $1.13 per pack, had illicit market shares averaging 16.8%.[^R2]

There are several types of illicit tobacco trade: large-scale organized smuggling, small-scale or ant smuggling, and counterfeiting.[^R2] The vast majority of illicit trade is the large scale illegal import of cigarettes by organized groups. In this type of trade, any tax level greater than zero means there is an incentive to smuggle cigarettes. The greater the tax/price difference between places, the higher the profit for smugglers though an incentive exists with any level of tax. However, it is the probability of getting caught and the harshness of sanctions that will most affect this part of illegal trade. Other factors, besides the ease and cost of smuggling, include the existence of organized crime and informal distribution networks, overall levels of corruption, and the extent of tobacco industry participation. Countering these factors, rather than lowering tobacco taxes, are therefore key to combating this kind of illicit tobacco trade.

These facts are well-illustrated by the experience of Canada. From 1980 to 1994, Canada raised tobacco taxes such that, by 1994, average Canadian cigarette taxes per pack were more than 5 times the US average. The market share of illicit tobacco peaked at 30% in 1993, but this was also a result of the long, poorly controlled border between Canada and the USA, price differences along the border, and the large proportion of Canadians living close to the USA border.[^R3] Much of these illegal cigarettes were in fact produced in Canada, but had been exported into the USA into the Akwsasne reservation and routed back into Canada. Further, investigative journalists have found that tobacco companies were colluding with criminal networks and selling off surplus cigarette-making machines to natives in the reserve, so they could produce bootleg cigarettes. By stimulating illicit trade, the tobacco industry could persuade Canadian policymakers to lower tobacco taxes.[^R4] Canada responded by lowering tobacco taxes in 1998 to decrease the incentive for illicit trade. Smuggling rates fell, but they also fell in provinces which had retained higher tax rates. The overall outcome was that tobacco consumption increased, and – despite more tobacco sales – revenues dropped.[^R3]

Small-scale or "ant smuggling is triggered when there are differences in tobacco prices between areas. People may, for example, buy more than the legal limit of tax-free imports, but the total smuggled amounts are relatively small. Another type of illegal trade is counterfeiting. The largest – and increasing – share of illicit cigarettes are no longer counterfeit or non-tax paid brands, but "cheap whites" which are cigarettes that are not sold legally anywhere, but produced solely for smuggling.[^R5] An example is the "Jin Ling" cigarette brand which, with help from tobacco companies, is smuggled from the Russian Federation and East European countries into the EU.[^R4]

Within the European Region there is another phenomenon: the illegal import of cigarettes from countries where taxes have been paid. These cigarettes mostly come from Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova and are legal if consumed in these countries, but become illegal when entering another country without paying taxes. Tax rates and cigarette prices are far lower in source countries than in the EU. Since governments in the source countries collect their tax revenue, they have little incentive to limit these sales. Within the EU, proximity to these countries is strongly associated with high levels of illicit trade.[^R6]

Illicit trade can be prevented in various ways. Supply-chain control mechanisms, such as requiring licenses to produce, transport and sell tobacco products, require that sellers of tobacco products &#39;know their customer&#39; and use tax stamps. Tax stamps are a simple but important part of increasing compliance. In the USA, for instance, tax stamps have been an effective means to reduce illicit tobacco trade between high-tax states such as Michigan, and low-tax states such as North Carolina. Between 1998 and 1999, the use of tax stamps increased gross state cigarette tax collections by 14%.[^R7] Though tax evaders can make counterfeit tax stamps, places such as California have dealt with this issue by using stamps that contain encrypted information identifying the name and address of the distributor, when the tax was applied, its value, and other features. The new stamps resulted in the seizure of millions of illegal cigarettes and identification of several tobacco smuggling rings, while California&#39;s revenue from tobacco increased by over $124 million within 20 months.[^R8]

**KEY ARGUMENTS**

- _Implementation guidelines for WHO FCTC Article 6,[^R9] on price and tax measures, state that the development of tobacco tax policies should be protected from the tobacco industry and any arguments made by its front groups._

- The Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products_[^R10] calls for stronger, co-operative systems to curb illicit tobacco trade._ _This includes measures such as licensing, regulations on international transit, and offences applicable to those complicit in illicit tobacco trade._

- _Given the tobacco industry&#39;s complicity in illicit tobacco trade, The_ Protocol _also calls for transparency in any interactions with the tobacco industry related to illicit trade matters._
