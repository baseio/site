# Large pictorial pack warnings and plain packaging work

> **KEY MESSAGE:** _The tobacco industry has consistently fought the implementation of large, pictorial warning labels and standardised packaging in favour of vague text warnings. Evidence has consistently shown that pictorial labels are effective at communicating the health risks of smoking to wider audiences, such as children and illiterate people, and that the positive effects of pictorial warnings are strengthened with standardised packaging. Implementation of these measures is key in protecting people from tobacco._

Evidence consistently shows that large, pictorial warning labels on tobacco packaging are effective at educating people on the health risks of smoking. They also encourage quitting among smokers, and discourage young people from taking up smoking.[^R1] More recently, research also shows that the effects of pictorial warning labels are potentiated by standardised packaging.

> Warning labels are essential for communicating the health risks of smoking, since smokers, as consumers, have a right to this information.[^R2] A large proportion of smokers, particularly those in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) or with a low education level, are unaware of many of the health effects of smoking. Pictorial warning labels thus act as a vehicle for promoting awareness to a wider audience, as they are more effective at reaching people in LMICs, illiterate people who cannot understand text warnings, people in lower socioeconomic groups, and children.[^R3] Surveys indicate that, in countries where large, pictorial warnings have been implemented, awareness of tobacco-related conditions (such as heart disease, lung cancer and impotence) among smokers is better.[^R4] There is also evidence that, due to enhanced knowledge on the health risks of smoking, pictorial labels tend to encourage positive trends such as the public acceptance of other tobacco control measures,[^R5] or quitting among smokers.[^R6]

Pictorial warnings are far more effective than text-only warnings,[^R1] and can be made more effective by placing them on the front of the pack, increasing their size, and designing them in a way that triggers an emotional reaction.[^R7] However, their effects tends to be diluted by branding elements – such as logos or attractive colours – on the packaging that promote a positive association with smoking. Smoker identities (e.g. &#39;glamorous&#39;) or product images (e.g. &#39;mild&#39;) tend to persist unless the pictorial label covers at least 90% of the pack display area.[^R8][^R9] These effects can, however, be eliminated by implementing standardised packaging which removes all logos, colours, brand images and other promotional information on tobacco packaging. Standardised packaging was implemented in Australia in 2012. Since then, several other countries, such as France, Ireland and the UK, are following suit.

The tobacco industry has vehemently resisted the implementation of warning labels and standardised packaging in favour of inconspicuous, vague text warnings.[^R10] This is because, for the industry, tobacco packaging is a crucial aspect of its marketing strategy,[^R11] much of which is targeted at children and females. In the words of a 1987 tobacco industry memo:

_&quot;As media restrictions continue to increase in many major world markets, our packaging becomes increasingly important as: a vehicle for communication, a statement about the smoker&#39;s personality and lifestyle, an expression of social acceptability.&quot;_[^R12][^R13]

The pack colour, design, and branding is used to create certain perceptions on the product and to target specific groups. Tobacco companies know from their own research, for example, that pastel-coloured packs convey freshness, innocence, and appeal more to young women and girls; that a lower health risk or &#39;mildness&#39; can be implied with light-coloured packaging; and that packs can be designed in a way that encourages smoking among youth.[^R12] Similarly, industry-independent research has found that false beliefs on the safety of some cigarette varieties, e.g. &#39;light&#39;, persist even when descriptors are removed, as they persist in the way the product is packaged and branded.[^R14][^R15]

Research indicates that standardised packaging increases the salience of health warnings, reduces consumer demand, and minimises opportunities for the tobacco industry to market its products to youth.[^R11] This is because standardised packaging is associated with a less attractive brand imagery or smoker identity, and thereby reduces the industry&#39;s ability to target children or other specific groups. Evidence from Australia also indicates that standardised packaging can promote smoking cessation.[^R16][^R17]


### KEY ARGUMENTS

- _Guidelines for WHO FCTC Article 12 (on education, communication, training and public awareness) stress the importance of educating_ everyone _on the harms of smoking, taking into account socioeconomic status, literacy, age, educational background and any other factors.[^R18] Pictorial warning labels are essential in communicating the risks to children, people in LMICs, people who are illiterate, or anyone else who may not understand the risks from vague text warnings._

- _In the Roadmap of Actions to Strengthen the Implementation of the WHO FCTC in the European Region 2015-2025_,[^R19] the protection of children and a gender-sensitive approach are among the guiding principles. Children and females should be protected from tobacco marketing by removing all logos, descriptors or other branding elements on tobacco packaging that are targeted at them.

- _Guidelines for Article 11 of the WHO FCTC, on the packaging and labelling of tobacco products_,[^R20] recommend pictorial health warnings on tobacco packs that are clear, visible, and legible. They should be positioned on the front and back, covering at least 50% of the display area. _These guidelines also support standardised packaging, since tobacco packaging and labelling should not be misleading with, for example, the use of colours that convey a lower health risk._
