# The tobacco industry uses front groups and third parties to hide its involvement

The tobacco industry has many faces, including not only tobacco manufacturers, wholesale distributors and importers of tobacco products, but also entities and individuals that work on behalf of or to further the interests of the tobacco industry.[^R1] Many different entities exist: retailers, farmers and growers, lawyers and law firms, scientists, lobbyists, NGOs promoting tobacco industry interests, PR and advertising agencies, researchers, paid consultants, university research centres and departments, and any other organizations or individuals that work to promote tobacco industry interests.

Within the European Union (EU), the use of third parties has become incredibly stylised and can be divided into four distinct groups.First are groups that are either part of the tobacco industry or were originally created by it. For instance, in the UK, the Tobacco Manufacturers Association[^R2] is a tobacco industry-owned group that lobbies on behalf of the industry; however, none of the transnational tobacco corporations describe it as such in their submissions. Second are tobacco industry suppliers such as the European Carton Makers Association,[^R3] which was very active in lobbying against the 2014 Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) with the help of Interel, a prestigious EU public affairs consultancy.

Third are business associations with tobacco industry membership that are perceived as presenting the wider business interest. Yet FOI documents reveal that two large tobacco companies were part of a campaign to set up a EU-wide business lobbying presence, in order to emphasise spill-over effects of TPD measures on other sectors. The intent was to create the impression that this network – 136 associations and 35 non-tobacco companies that lobbied against TPD measures – was operating independently from the tobacco industry.[^R4]

Fourth are academic groups funded by tobacco companies, such as Deloitte, the International Tax and Investment Center (ITIC), KPMG, Populus, Transcrime as well as academic professors. It should be noted that ITIC is particularly powerful throughout the world and operates widely within the European Region. Founded in 1993, the four biggest tobacco companies fund it and are represented on its board of directors. ITIC provides its sponsors &#39;a seat at the policy making table&#39; and lobbies in the tobacco industry&#39;s interests. ITIC appears to be highly influential in tax policy as it employs high level ex-tax officials, thus giving it credibility and direct access to finance ministries (see 2.2: &#39;It is important to prevent tobacco industry interference in tobacco control&#39;).

Although not a new tactic, the production of a skewed evidence base by the tobacco industry continues to be effective because of the wide dissemination that the tobacco industry is able to promote. Generally, tobacco companies pay academic researchers, institutions or consultants to conduct research that ultimately serves to create denial over legitimate science, promote the alleged benefits of smoking, or undermine tobacco control policies. This research is often not based on sound logic or methodology, but is nevertheless widely disseminated and communicated through media channels.

The tobacco industry continues its constant and loud contestation of public health evidence, particularly for newer policy developments such as plain packaging, and conceals its own ties to the information and evidence that is produced. The manufacture of evidence is particularly powerful and effective in the context of particular tobacco control policies, such as tobacco taxation and illicit trade. Using misleading evidence, the tobacco industry and its beneficiaries will, for example, give advice to ministries of finance which do not always have other information to counterbalance this.
