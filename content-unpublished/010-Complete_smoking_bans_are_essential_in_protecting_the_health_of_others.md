# Complete smoking bans are essential in protecting the health of others

> **KEY MESSAGE:** _The tobacco industry has tried to deter the implementation of smokefree legislations by shifting focus onto other issues with industry-funded &#39;science&#39;, and by using front groups to argue that ventilation or partial smoking bans are adequate. However, evidence strongly and consistently indicates that second-hand smoke has serious effects on the health of others, and the only way to protect people from these to implement complete smoking bans in all indoor places where others are present._

Smoking has serious impacts on the health of others, particularly children, across the lifecourse. Smoking in pregnancy can result in complications such as miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth, and low birth weight which predisposes the child to chronic diseases later in life. It also increases the risk of developmental conditions such as cleft lip, limb reduction, or congenital heart defects.[^R1] Heavy smoking during pregnancy can result in the child being born with nicotine dependence.[^R2] Paternal smoking can also affect child development, as it affects sperm quality and can increase the child&#39;s risk of suffering from postnatal health problems such as childhood cancer, genetic disorders, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), and physical malformations.[^R3] Despite these risks, smoking in pregnancy remains the leading cause of poor pregnancy outcome and prenatal death in the European Region.[^R4]

After birth, exposure to second-hand smoke (SHS) poses an important health threat. SHS contains hundreds of carcinogenic or toxic chemicals such as arsenic, formaldehyde, vinyl chloride and benzene, and is a known human carcinogen.[^R5]It contains higher concentrations of many toxic chemicals than the smoke inhaled by smokers, because SHS is not filtered and is burned at a lower temperature which results in a more incomplete, impure combustion.[^R6] There is evidence that exposure to SHS has cardiovascular impacts that are akin to active smoking.[^R7] Even brief exposures to SHS can have an immediate impact on the cardiovascular system, causing blood platelets to stick together, damage to the blood vessel walls,[^R8] and other cardiovascular effects which increase the risk of heart attack.[^R9] Irritants in SHS, when breathed in, can trigger asthma attacks in asthmatic people even upon brief exposure.[^R10][^R11]

> Children, whose bodies are still developing, are especially sensitive to the toxicants in SHS. Children exposed to SHS are at a 50-100% higher risk of acute respiratory illness and more likely to suffer from asthma, middle ear infections, behavioural disorders, and SIDS. They are also more likely to start smoking in future.[^R12] Adults exposed to SHS on a daily basis are also at increased risks of disease: they are 25-30% more likely to develop heart disease, have a 20-30% higher risk of developing lung cancer,[^R13] and are at a higher risk of developing other fatal conditions such as breast cancer.[^R14]

Thus there is no level of SHS exposure that can be considered safe, and SHS is still harmful if it travels from one room to another, when smoke is allowed to air out of the room, or when it is filtered through a ventilation system. The only proper protection from SHS is a complete ban on smoking in all enclosed spaces where others are present.[^R15] Nevertheless, exposure to SHS remains common in the European Region. In 2004, it was estimated that 58% of children and approximately 60% of adults in the Region were exposed to SHS. This corresponded to a burden of roughly 130,000 deaths, most which were from ischaemic heart disease, and this represented the highest rates of death (over 30 per 100,000 capita) than in any other Region.[^R16] Currently, roughly half (54%) of children aged under 15 are exposed to SHS inside the home, and most (74%) are exposed to SHS outside the home.[^R17] Exposure to SHS, particularly for children, is therefore an important and ongoing problem in the European Region which calls for stricter regulations on where people can smoke.

The tobacco industry has always viewed the SHS issue as an important challenge to its reputation and profits. When evidence on the harms of SHS surfaced in the 1980&#39;s, the industry was concerned that this would result in litigations, smoking bans, and reduced tobacco sales. The industry responded by discrediting legitimate research on SHS and sponsoring &#39;scientific activities&#39; designed to shift focus onto other issues.[^R18][^R19] In tobacco industry-funded research, chronic diseases among non-smokers were then attributed to everything except SHS: engine pollution, incense burning, heat and humidity (in places such as Southeast Asia), and cooking with barbecues or coal burners.[^R20] However, none of these factors come close to the health impacts created by SHS exposure, which currently kills approximately 600,000 non-smokers globally per year; most of whom are women and children.[^R21]

The tobacco industry has also tried to dissuade the implementation of indoor smoking bans by arguing that a partial ban or ventilation is sufficient. This was done via industry-funded consultants, who presented themselves as independent from the industry. Such consultants would usually promote their &#39;ventilation solution&#39; to the hospitality sector and to legislative bodies.[^R22] However, this solution was based on inaccurate science: it is now known that only a complete ban offers adequate protection from the health effects of SHS.[^R13] In Spain, for example, respiratory symptoms among hospitality workers decreased by 72% in venues that became fully smokefree, but no large decreases in symptoms were observed among workers in venues that only went partially smokefree.[^R23] Full smoking bans are highly effective: in Italy, two years after the introduction of complete smoking bans in bars and clubs, the lifetime excess risk of lung cancer mortality among workers decreased from 10-20x to negligible.[^R24] There is also evidence – for example from California – that smokefree laws can lead to significant improvements in respiratory health among workers within just two months of their implementation.[^R25]

There is strong evidence, then, that complete smoking bans provide significant health benefits to others in the long and short term, while partial bans or so-called &#39;harm reductive&#39; strategies offer very little – if any – benefit. More recently, there is also emerging evidence that exposure to SHS in public outdoor areas, such as _al fresco_ dining areas and sidewalk cafes, is harmful to the health of others.[^R26][^R27] This may justify smoking bans in some outdoor areas, especially if more evidence emerges on this in the near future.

### KEY ARGUMENTS

- _According to Article 12 of the_ International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights_,[^R28] everyone has a right to the highest attainable standard of health and according to the Article 3 of the_ Universal Declaration of Human Rights_,[^R29] everyone has a right to life. It follows that no-one should be forced to breathe in air that is carcinogenic and potentially life-threatening._

- _According to the_ Convention on the Rights of the Child_, children have a right to life (Article 6) and a right to a safe and clean environment (Article 24).[^R30] In supporting these rights, it is essential to protect children from SHS._

- _Guidelines for Article 8 of the WHO FCTC,[^R31] on the protection from exposure to tobacco smoke, state that smoking should be banned in all indoor public spaces, workplaces, transport, and in other public places as appropriate, and that proper enforcement mechanisms should be secured._

- _In line with WHO FCTC Article 12,[^R32] on education, communication, training and public awareness, everyone should be made aware of the health threats posed by SHS._
