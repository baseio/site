# Smokefree legislations boost the hospitality industry.

> **KEY MESSAGE:** _The tobacco industry has, along with the hospitality industry, argued that smokefree legislations in venues such as bars and restaurants have a negative impact on the hospitality industry. This is a myth: independent, methodologically rigorous studies have shown that they have positive or neutral impacts on hospitality industry revenue._

Smokefree legislations in public places such as hotels, bars and restaurants benefit the hospitality industry in a number of ways. Exposure to second-hand smoke (SHS) can have serious health consequences (see 1.1: &#39;Second-hand smoke has serious effects on the health of others&#39;). Smokefree laws improve the health of workers, who experience significant health benefits both in the short-term[^R1] and long-term.[^R2] These, in turn, improve worker productivity and contribute to all the economic benefits associated with better health (see 2.3: &#39;Longer, healthier lives have a positive overall effect on the economy&#39;). Net revenue in hospitality venues also increases because the majority of people do not smoke and, if aware of the adverse health effects of SHS, prefer to be in smokefree places. This is particularly the case for families who want to protect their children from SHS, for smokers trying to quit, and for ex-smokers who do not want to be surrounded by other people smoking.

Literature on the economic impacts of smokefree legislation on the hospitality industry, particularly in earlier studies, has drawn mixed results. The reasons behind this are well-demonstrated in a 2003 review. This review examined 97 studies and initially drew mixed conclusions. Studies were then selected based on their methodological rigour; 21 well-designed were then selected for analysis. These 21 studies all found that full smoking bans had either neutral or positive impacts on sales or employment in bars and restaurants. The review also found that 94% of the studies that reported a negative economic impact were funded by the tobacco industry.[^R3]

Studies that have used objective measures such as changes in sales, employment and the number of establishments have shown that, in most developed countries, there were no adverse impacts as a result of going completely smokefree in bars, restaurants and tourist areas. In most countries, the overall economic impacts have been positive (see case study: Hungary).[^R4] A UK study, for example, has found that there was a net increase of 155,000 jobs in the leisure and entertainment industries, since smokers who quit are then more likely to spend a larger proportion of their income on recreation and entertainment.[^R5]

A smoking ban should be complete, since partial smoking bans or air filtering solutions do not provide adequate protection from SHS (see 2.2: &#39;Ventilation or partial smoking bans do not protect others from the harmful effects of second-hand smoke&#39;). Nevertheless, the tobacco industry has, often along with the hospitality industry, tried to resist the implementation of complete smoking bans by arguing that they would have a negative economic impact on the hospitality industry. The proposed &#39;solution&#39; is then a partial smoking ban or expensive air filtering system; neither of which offers adequate health protection (see case study: Hungary). Though many of these arguments seem to be coming from hospitality industry representatives, research on tobacco industry documents indicates that the tobacco industry has been involved in manipulating the hospitality sector, primarily via financial contributions to hospitality associations or the formation of its own front groups.[^R6]

### KEY ARGUMENTS

- _Guidelines for WHO FCTC Article 8,[^R7] on the protection from exposure to tobacco smoke, state that all indoor public places should be completely smokefree. The guidelines also state that industry-proposed &#39;solutions&#39; such as partial smoking bans and ventilation systems have repeatedly proven to be ineffective._

- _In line with WHO FCTC Article 5.3,[^R8] the development of public health policy should be protected from the commercial and vested interests of the tobacco industry. This includes the manipulation of the hospitality sector and use of front groups to resist smokefree legislations._
