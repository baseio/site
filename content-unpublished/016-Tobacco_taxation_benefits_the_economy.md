# Tobacco taxation benefits the economy even if smoking rates drop.

> **KEY MESSAGE:** _Tobacco taxes are cheap to implement, they are a fast and effective way to reduce tobacco consumption, and generate large revenues for the state within a short time. This results in a win-win situation, as revenue tends to increase even while smoking rates continue to drop._

Tobacco taxes are an effective way to reduce consumption and generate revenue at the same time. It is estimated that, on average, tobacco tax revenues are 269 times higher than spends on tobacco control interventions.[^R1] Tobacco taxes are the cheapest of all tobacco control measures to implement, with an estimated cost of just $0.05 per person each year in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).[^R2] Taxes are also directly linked to declines in tobacco consumption, which in turn results in a reduced smoking prevalence, fewer incidences of tobacco-related diseases, and all the economic benefits associated with these (see 2.3: ['Longer, healthier lives have a positive overall effect on the economy']()). To illustrate, in France there were large increases in tobacco tax starting in 1990, which resulted in a 3-fold increase in the inflation-adjusted price of cigarettes by 2009. Meanwhile, by 2009 cigarette consumption had halved from 6 to 3 cigarettes per adult per day, and lung cancer rates halved while revenues from tobacco tax doubled, from €6 billion to €12 billion.[^R3]

In theory, when taxes are continually raised, cigarette consumption will decrease to the point at which revenues will begin to fall. But this point has not been reached in most places (see: [Case study UK](#casestudyuk)). This is in part because tobacco is highly addictive and therefore has a low price elasticity. Tobacco has an average price elasticity of -0.4, which means that as prices increase by 10%, demand reduces by 4%. The price elasticity of tobacco varies between countries: for example in Sweden it is estimated at -0.81, and in Estonia at -0.34. In LMICs, the average price elasticity is higher. As time goes by, people adjust to the price change and are expected to reduce their consumption further. For instance, in Poland the price elasticity of tobacco is -0.4 in the short term, and -0.7 in the long term.[^R4]

Price elasticity also varies depending on age and socioeconomic status. Young people are approximately 2-3 times more responsive to price changes than adults. People on a low income also respond more readily, which means that tobacco taxation can help to prevent tobacco-related health inequalities, in particular if revenue from tobacco tax is used to fund healthcare and social programmes (see 2.3: ['Tobacco use reinforces poverty and health inequalities']()).[^R5][^R6]

For a tax increase to be effective in reducing consumption, it should reduce the affordability of tobacco; it should therefore be sensitive to factors such as inflation, real income changes and the relative price of tobacco products. For instance, if only certain tobacco products are subject to tax, people may switch to cheaper alternatives (such as loose tobacco). If a country experiences high inflation and a high growth in income, tax increases will not necessarily reduce the affordability of tobacco. If a country has very low excise rates in monetary terms, a large percentage increase in excise rates will only result in a small price increase of tobacco. This increases revenue but does not reduce tobacco consumption, so the result is a revenue-only win.

In Kyrgyzstan, for example, tobacco excise rates were increased 4-fold from 2011 to 2014. This created a 5-fold increase in revenue but no drop in tobacco consumption, as the rise in excise tax did not reduce the affordability of tobacco.[^R7] This illustrates that, if a country with very low taxes is seeking a &#39;win-win&#39; scenario (health _and_ revenue gains), tax hikes should be very high. In Ukraine, for example, excise tax was increased 6-fold within 22 months, which resulted in a 5-fold increase in revenue along with a 26% drop in tobacco sales.[^R8]

When excise tax is already high, even a modest percentage increase can increase tobacco prices above household income growth, which reduces affordability and results in a win-win scenario. This is the case in most countries where tax rates are high (see case study: UK). A health-win scenario is also possible: when affordability (and thereby consumption) of tobacco is reduced, but there is no change in revenue. This was the case in Greece, for example, as a result of their economic recession in 2011-2013.[^R7]

The tobacco industry has, for obvious reasons, considered taxation measures as a threat. One tobacco company, for example, noted as early as 1985 that:

> _"Of all the concerns, there is one—taxation—that alarms us the most. While marketing restrictions and public [sic] and passive smoking do depress volume, in our experience taxation depresses it much more severely. Our concern for taxation is, therefore, central to our thinking about smoking and health"_  
(Quoted from [^R4])

The tobacco industry utilises various strategies to undermine tax policies. Some tobacco companies have engaged in illicit tobacco trade and then used this argument to dispute increases in tobacco taxes (see 2.2: &#39;Tobacco taxation does not result in illicit trade&#39;). Forestalling is another tactic, in which companies increase the rate of clearance of tobacco stocks so they are released into the market immediately before prices increase. Tobacco prices are also reduced via coupons and promotional discounts; a vast majority of the tobacco industry&#39;s marketing expenditures are spent on these.[^R9]

Another pricing strategy used to undermine the impact of tobacco taxes is the development of low-price brands.[^R10] The tobacco industry categorises tobacco brands into four price segments: premium, economy, mid, and &#39;ultra-low price&#39;. When taxes increase, the tobacco industry increases its prices (thus overshifting taxes), but only on the more expensive brands. Meanwhile, tax increases are absorbed for ultra-low price brands, such that the price of these brands remains the same, or even decreases, in spite of tax increases. The result is an increase in the price gap between ultra-low price brands and more expensive brands, while the market share for ultra-price brands goes up. If prices for different types of brand are not monitored or raised equally, this effect is hidden within the overall excise increase. It is therefore important to ensure that lower price brands are also affected by tax increases, and properly monitored in terms of price changes.[^R11]



### KEY ARGUMENTS

- _Guidelines for WHO FCTC Article 6,[^R12] on price and tax measures to reduce the demand of tobacco, state that:_

- _An effective tobacco tax policy should lead to higher real consumer prices, taking into account factors such as inflation and changes in household income. Taxes should also be increased or adjusted on a regular basis._

- _The simplest and most efficient tax system should be implemented, considering in particular specific or mixed excise systems with a minimum specific tax floor in favour of purely_ ad valorem _systems._

- _To prevent people switching to cheaper brands, all tobacco products should be taxed in a comparable way and the tax burden on different tobacco products – particularly cheaper alternatives – should be monitored._

- _Tax policy should include efficient tax administration systems to enhance compliance, and mechanisms to prevent forestalling._

**Case study: UK**

Cigarette prices in the UK are among the world’s highest. Since 1993, tobacco taxes have been increasing at rates greater than inflation, with the exception of 2001-2008 when taxes increased at the same rate as inflation. The affordability of tobacco index, which measures tobacco affordability relative to real household income, has also consistently decreased in the UK: between 2004 and 2014, tobacco became 30% less affordable.[^UK1] Meanwhile, smoking prevalence has been falling steadily, from 29% (1992) to 20% (2014), and average tobacco consumption per smoker has dropped from 13.6 (1992) to 10.5 (2014) cigarettes per day.[^UK2]

The chart below illustrates the revenues collected from tobacco tax each year in absolute value and as a percentage of the UK’s gross domestic product, from 1980 to 2015. Despite consistent drops in smoking prevalence, revenues have increased with each year from just over £6 billion (1992/93) to almost £10 billion (2014/15).[^UK3] The drop in 1999/2000 was due to increased illicit trade activity, which was followed by counter-mechanisms starting in 2000 that have successfully suppressed illicit trade. The chart also shows that revenues from tobacco tax in the UK have remained consistently high since 2011/12.
