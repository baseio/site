# Tobacco smoking is, for most, not a &#39;free choice&#39;.

> **KEY MESSAGE:** _The tobacco industry and its front groups argue that smoking is a free choice, but the reality for most smokers is that it is an addiction that starts in childhood. Tobacco-free initiatives prevent addiction, debilitating disease and death, and thereby protect the freedom of smokers, the people around them, and children. Support for tobacco-free initiatives should be gained by educating people on these facts, and by highlighting the flaws in pro-tobacco &#39;free choice&#39; arguments._

&#39;Free choice&#39; does not just arise from having options: it also originates from the _ability to choose_ between options. This ability, termed &#39;autonomy&#39;, may be defined as the ability to act in line with one&#39;s own motives, reasons, and values.[^R1] Making an autonomous (and therefore free) choice also requires that it is an _informed_ choice: that the possible implications of making that choice are properly communicated and understood. Smoking is not compatible with the notion of &#39;free choice&#39; for several reasons.

First, tobacco is highly addictive. Addiction is a clinically recognised mental disorder with clear and diagnosable behavioural, psychological, and neurobiological symptoms. It is usually diagnosed with behavioural criteria. In the 5th _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders_ (DSM-5), for example, &#39;tobacco use disorder&#39; includes criteria such as: consuming more than intended; persistent (and often unsuccessful) efforts to quit or cut down; continued use despite persistent or recurrent problems that result from use; difficulty in abstaining despite knowledge of the risks. These particular criteria reflect some lack of control over smoking, even though the individual – on some level – wants to quit.[^R2]

Cigarettes are addictive mostly due to the actions of nicotine, which enters the brain and affects neurobiological functions in a similar way to other addictive drugs such as heroin and cocaine.[^R3] More specifically, nicotine stimulates the release of dopamine and adrenaline which provide smokers with a sense of energy, relaxation, and euphoria (the nicotine &#39;high&#39;). However, these effects are transient due to the short half-life of nicotine.[^R4] If smoking is repeated, the brain becomes accustomed to sustained nicotine delivery and undergoes a series of re-adaptations. The net effect is that the overall level of dopamine and other &#39;feel-good&#39; chemicals in the brain (such as endorphins) is reduced. The individual then becomes increasingly reliant on nicotine to boost levels of these chemicals, in order to maintain an acceptable level of emotional wellbeing.[^R5]

The addictiveness of cigarettes is further increased by their design. Nicotine is inhaled, so it reaches the brain within seconds. This makes it more addictive than, say, alcohol which is consumed orally. Many cigarettes also contain additives to facilitate a more rapid absorption of nicotine, such as bronchodilators (e.g. cocoa and licorice) and freebasing agents (e.g. ammonia). &#39;Freebasing&#39; is a process by which a drug is detached from its salt base, which allows its faster absorption into the brain. It is also used to increase the high of other drugs such as cocaine (which is freebased into &#39;crack&#39;).[^R6] The result is that tobacco, even in comparison to many illegal drugs, is highly addictive. In a study led by a panel of drug experts, tobacco was ranked as the third most addictive drug in terms of its pharmacological properties, closely following heroin and &#39;crack&#39; cocaine.[^R7] However, it must be noted that this assessment did not take into account the ubiquity of tobacco in society. This makes it even more difficult for nicotine-addicted individuals to avoid smoking, as cues that trigger tobacco cravings (e.g. tobacco displays in shops or tobacco adverts) are more difficult to avoid.

The result is that quitting smoking is extremely difficult, even if the individual really wants to quit. Only 3-7% unaided attempts are successful; if cessation aids such as approved nicotine replacement therapy, varenicline or cognitive behavioural therapy are used, success rate is 25%.[^R8] These low success rates are not because most smokers have no motivation to quit: an estimated 90% of smokers regret that they ever started smoking,[^R9] and in any given year approximately 40-50% of smokers attempt to quit.[^R10] Since most smokers do not seek medical help in their quit attempts, it is difficult to derive the exact proportion of smokers who have developed an addiction to nicotine. However, a conservative estimate is that at least half of all smokers are addicted, and would have significant problems with quitting even if they would prefer to give it up.[^R11] This means that most smokers have a limited ability to resist using nicotine: their ability to choose between two options – to smoke or to _not_ smoke – is impaired to some degree.

One may argue that smokers _want_ to be addicted and that smoking is in line with their autonomous preferences. The reasoning behind these preferences is, however, rarely based on a sound evaluation of the possible consequences. Studies have found that smokers, even if aware of the health risks, grossly underestimate their own personal risk of disease and premature death compared to other smokers. This approach, termed &#39;self-exemption&#39;, is a way of reconciling a tobacco addiction with the disturbing awareness of the possible health risks.[^R12] This usually takes the form of rationalisations that reject, diminish or offset the risks. For example, smokers often adopt a fatalistic approach (e.g. &#39;everyone dies of something&#39;); but this overlooks the years lost to reduced quality of life and disability from chronic tobacco-related diseases.[^R13] Smokers often cite anecdotes of a lifelong smoker who survived to an old age; but this ignores scientific evidence which shows that these stories are relatively rare.[^R14] Smokers may also engage in compensatory behaviour, such as eating healthily to offset the risks of smoking, even though smoking is the single largest risk factor for premature death and disease regardless of other health-related behaviours.[^R15]

Second, the decision to start smoking – before addiction develops – is not a free choice. Most smoking initiations are in childhood, before the ability to properly appreciate the effects of smoking and addiction is developed and when the neurobiological risk of developing an addiction is higher. Young people also tend to overestimate their ability to quit later in life,[^R16] and tend to focus on the short-term benefits of smoking – such as acquiring a socially desired identity – while reasoning &#39;I&#39;ll quit later&#39;.[^R17] This is further enforced by the tobacco industry&#39;s marketing, which often targets young people. Third, the industry&#39;s involvement in scientific research and lobbying makes it difficult for people to make an _informed_ choice to smoke, since the information shared from these activities tends to be scientifically inaccurate, biased and misleading, but is nevertheless widely disseminated to the public by the industry&#39;s front groups (see: ['The tobacco industry uses front groups and third parties to hide its involvement']()). Fourth, it should be noted that second-hand smoke (SHS) affects the freedom of others to visit places without being exposed to serious health risks.

To support people&#39;s free choices in the context of tobacco, it is important to protect others from SHS and to help smokers in their quit efforts by providing adequate cessation services. It is also important to protect children from tobacco and to ensure that everyone has access to accurate information on the immediate and long-term risks of smoking. This includes preventing the spread of misleading information by the tobacco industry and its front groups, and educating people on the fact that smoking is, for most, an addiction and not a &#39;free choice&#39;.

The tobacco industry has often relied on the &#39;smoking is a free choice&#39; argument, particularly in more liberal countries where awareness of the health risks of smoking is higher. The logic of this argument is that smoking, though harmful, is a personal choice that should be left up to individuals. This argument fails for at least four reasons (see above),  and the tobacco industry itself has noted as early as 1973 that this argument was, most likely, factually incorrect:

> _"To some extent the argument revolving around &quot;free choice&quot; is being negated on the grounds of addiction. The threat is that this argument will increase significantly and lead to further restrictions on product specifications and greater danger in litigation."_[^R18]

The tobacco industry responded by denying the addictiveness of tobacco, and paid academics to write about tobacco in ways that would trivialise its addictiveness. Thus tobacco was compared to substances such as coffee, chocolate, and alcohol. Meanwhile, smoking – which is far more addictive than coffee, chocolate, or alcohol – was defended as an exercise of freedom,[^R19] and public health interventions were criticised as unreasonable restrictions on this freedom.[^R20]

This turned the reality on its head: smoking, an addictive health hazard, was portrayed as a consumer choice. The tobacco industry achieved this mainly by appealing to a superficial notion of &#39;freedom&#39;: freedom that arises from having as many options as possible. Meanwhile, the importance of smokers&#39; freedom from addiction, the freedom of others from SHS, and the freedom of children from the tobacco industry&#39;s marketing practices was ignored. Public health interventions were discredited as &#39;authoritarian&#39;, while smokers were depicted as victims of social and political oppression. However, the tobacco industry knew that the logic behind these arguments was incorrect and essentially a public relations strategy to escape tobacco regulations. In the words of a 1995 tobacco industry memo:

> _"What is clever about the campaign idea is that it makes the smoker the victim, whose rights need protecting, rather than the non-smoker who needs protecting from the smoker"_[^R21]

In a similar vein, the &#39;nanny state&#39; argument was – and remains – a common tool for the tobacco industry to reject state intervention. In this argument, the state is depicted as the paternalistic &#39;nanny&#39; that won&#39;t let people think for themselves, while smokers are portrayed as victims who cannot act responsibly without state intervention. Thus the &#39;nanny state&#39; argument goes a step further than the &#39;free choice&#39; argument in that it also infantilises smokers.[^R22] In both cases, smokers and non-smokers are camped against each other: the non-smokers are set up on the side of the state, and – together with the state – are portrayed as the health fanatic, oppressive &#39;authority&#39;. Smokers are then seen as victims of oppression who must fight against state control.[^R23]

The tobacco industry has also drawn on political sentiments within a particular place or context to gain support. In Germany, for example, regulations on tobacco are labelled &#39;health fascist&#39;. The result is that, in Germany, it is more difficult to gain public support for regulations on tobacco.[^R24][^R25] In the UK, political sentiments on religious fanaticism have been used to depict tobacco control as &#39;the Tobacco Taliban&#39;.[^R26] When smoking bans were first implemented in public places, the tobacco industry compared them to an &#39;apartheid&#39; between smokers and non-smokers. Smokers were then urged to not comply with these laws and to stand up against discrimination from the state and non-smokers. This approach set up an unnecessary antagonism between smokers and non-smokers as it overlooked the fact that smoking bans do not actually discriminate against _smokers_. Smokers, unlike in apartheid, were still allowed on premises provided that they did not expose others to SHS. Meanwhile, non-smokers were encouraged to be more &#39;liberal&#39; and to avoid these unpopular portrayals, by tolerating SHS and effectively put their own health at risk to avoid social conflict.[^R27]

In reality, it is not tobacco control interventions that create friction between smokers and non-smokers. Friction is created in the ways in which these interventions are framed and sold to the public by the tobacco industry and its front groups. Tobacco-free initiatives are not authoritarian: they prevent addiction, debilitating disease and death, and thereby protect the autonomy and freedom of smokers, the people around them, and children. Restrictions on the tobacco industry&#39;s manipulative marketing practices protect people – particularly children and socially disadvantaged people – from being exploited and misinformed, and thereby protect people&#39;s abilities to make informed choices. Support for tobacco-free initiatives can be gained by educating people on these facts, and by highlighting flaws in pro-tobacco &#39;free choice&#39; arguments.
