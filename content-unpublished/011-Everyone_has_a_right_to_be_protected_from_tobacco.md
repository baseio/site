# Everyone has a right to be protected from tobacco.

> **KEY MESSAGE:** _There is no &#39;right to smoke&#39;, although smokers – like everyone else – have a right to be healthy, free from addiction, and protected from the tobacco industry&#39;s marketing practices. Tobacco-free initiatives support a_ _number of fundamental human rights such as the rights to health, life and non-discrimination, women&#39;s rights, children&#39;s rights, and rights of people with severe mental illnesses._

According to the _Universal Declaration of Human Rights_ (UDHR)[^R1] and _International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights_ (ICCPR),[^R2] everyone has a right to life (UDHR Article 3, ICCPR Article 6). According to the _International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights_ (ICESCR),[^R3] everyone has a right to _&quot;the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard_ _of physical and mental health&quot;_, which includes the _&quot;prevention, treatment and control of epidemic, endemic, occupational and other diseases&quot;_ (ICESCR Article 12). Smoking is a major cause of addiction and chronic disease, and an epidemic that is responsible for 16% of all mortalities in the European Region. It has serious impacts on the lives and health of an estimated 252 million smokers in the Region and the people around them.[^R4] In protecting the human rights to life and health, it is essential to protect people from tobacco.

According to the _Convention on the Rights of the Child_ (CRC),[^R5] children have a right to life which means that governments should _&quot;__ensure that children survive and develop healthily&quot;_ (CRC Article 6). Children also have a right to a _&quot;clean and safe environment&#39;&#39;_ (CRC Article 24), the right to be protected from _&quot;the use of harmful drugs&quot;_ such as tobacco (CRC Article 33) and a right to _&quot;be protected from any activity that takes advantage… or could harm their welfare and development&quot;_, such as the exploitative marketing practices of the tobacco industry (CRC Article 36). Yet millions of children in the Region continue to be targeted by tobacco industry marketing, which clearly takes advantage of their impressionability and has devastating impacts on their future welfare and development. In supporting the right of children to be protected from activity that takes advantage of them (CRC Article 36), it is essential to restrict all tobacco marketing activities targeted at children or young people.

An estimated 74% of children in the European Region are exposed to second-hand smoke (SHS) outside the home. This can have serious impacts on their health (see: &#39;Complete smoking bans are essential to protect the health of others&#39;).[^R6] However, governments have a duty to ensure that children develop healthily (CRC Article 6) and live in a clean and safe environment (CRC Article 24). To protect these rights, complete smoking bans should be implemented in all public places where children go and awareness should be raised on the effects of SHS on children&#39;s health. Smoking among children is also an issue in the European Region. In some places, smoking experimentation rates among children age 15 are estimated to be as high as 61%.[^R7] Yet, children have a right to health (CRC Article 6) and a right to be protected from the use of harmful drugs (CRC Article 33). These rights should be protected by implementing measures that deter children from smoking such as education initiatives, tobacco taxation, bans on tobacco advertising, promotions and sponsorships, and the normalisation of tobacco-free lifestyles.

> Tobacco marketing is often targeted to people on the basis of their race, gender, socioeconomic status, or sexual orientation. Yet, according to UDHR Articles 2 and 7, everyone has an equal right to health:

_&quot;without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, or other status&quot;_[^R1]

According to the _Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities_ (CRPD),[^R8] people with severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia also have a right to health without being discriminated against on the basis of their mental illness (CRPD Article 25), and a right to be protected from exploitation (CRPD Article 16). In protecting these rights, it is essential to protect them from the tobacco industry&#39;s targeted marketing practices and to adopt an equitable approach in tobacco-free initiatives.This may involve focusing on social factors that are known to trigger or sustain tobacco use, such as stressful social environments or misleading pro-tobacco arguments propagated by the tobacco industry and its front groups. This would also protect people&#39;s right to social conditions that support good health (UDHR Article 25).

The industry targets females in the European Region by marketing smoking as a symbol of feminism and sex appeal. The tobacco industry has also taken advantage of social pressures for women to stay slim by marketing smoking as a means to lose weight.[^R9] Yet, according to the _Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women_(CEDAW):[^R10] _&quot;__Parties shall take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in the field of health care&quot;_ (CEDAW Article 12). In eliminating discrimination in the field of healthcare and supporting women&#39;s rights, it is necessary to eliminate all tobacco marketing targeted at women and to help all women to stay tobacco-free across the life-course.

Put together, tobacco-free initiatives support a number of fundamental human rights such as the rights to health, life, non-discrimination, social conditions that support good health, women&#39;s rights, children&#39;s rights, and rights of people with severe mental illnesses. Yet it is often argued, primarily by the tobacco industry and its front groups, that smokers have liberty rights and therefore a &quot;right to smoke&quot;.[^R11]

The tobacco industry first became interested in human rights-based arguments in the 1970&#39;s, when concerns about the health threats of SHS prompted discussions on smoking bans in public places. In an attempt to oppose these restrictions, the industry created &quot;smoker&#39;s rights&quot; front groups. In the European Region, these were set up in a number of countries such as the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, France, Switzerland, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Sweden, and Spain.[^R12] In some of these countries, such &quot;smoker&#39;s rights&quot; groups still exist. The main argument of these front groups is well-summarised in a 1991 manifesto, which formed part of a tobacco industry-funded conference on smoker&#39;s rights:

_&quot;We advocate the following principles: that smoking is a human right and should be respected according to the Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations; the choice to smoke should be respected as part of our wider choices in personal life, and as such should not be interfered with by the state…&quot;_[^R13]

However, the &#39;smoking is a human right&#39; argument lacks theoretical rigour for various reasons. Since smoking is highly addictive, it is not compatible with the notion of &#39;free choice&#39; (see: &#39;Tobacco smoking is, for most, not a free choice but an addiction&#39;). Even if it were, it is highly unlikely that it would translate into a liberty _right_ given the serious and widespread effects of smoking on the health of smokers and the people around them. Permitting this choice would violate fundamental rights such as children&#39;s rights and the rights to life and health. Some choices, then, should be restricted to ensure the protection of these rights. In UDHR Article 29, these restrictions are considered as necessary in order to:

_&quot;respect… the rights and freedoms of others and… [to meet] the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society&quot;_

In other words, _there is no right to smoke_, although smokers – like everyone else – have a right to be healthy and free from addiction, and a right to be protected from the tobacco industry&#39;s misleading marketing activities. In tobacco-free initiatives, support can be gained by highlighting the errors in &#39;right to smoke&#39; arguments, and by pointing out the fundamental human rights that are supported by tobacco-free initiatives.


### KEY ARGUMENTS

- _The_ &quot;protection from threats to fundamental human rights and freedoms&quot; _forms part of the guiding principles of the_ Roadmap of Actions to Strengthen the Implementation of the WHO FCTC in the European Region 2015-2025_,[^R14]_ _and the_ WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control_.[^R15]_

- _In tobacco-free initiatives, it is essential to draw on human rights treaties such as the_ Universal Declaration of Human Rights _and the_ Convention on the Rights of the Child _as they emphasise that smoking is not only a public health issue: it is also an important human rights issue._
